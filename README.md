Countries Autocomplete
======================

Use the included design and your own Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a webpage that allows the user to add countries to a list using autocomplete.


### Included

* design.png - use as a reference, not meant to be pixel perfect representation
* countries.csv - the country data in CSV format (format: name, code, 32x16 image name, 128x64 image name)
* flags/ - image assets for each country's flag, in two size formats: 32x16 and 128x64


### Rules / Details

* Do not worry about persisting the list or remove/edit functionality or similar. Keep it simple, just adding items to the list using autocomplete.
* We have no strict guidelines for how the autocomplete should work (i.e. how many results to return, etc), use your own judgement!
* You can use jQuery, but no other third-party code for the Javascript or CSS; however, CSS and HTML preprocessors are allowed if you prefer.
* Feel free to use any reference resources, just make sure to cite them (aside from any language or standard library documentation)


There are various minor decisions and differences that go into different solutions, so don't worry about matching our exact solution - use your best judgement. We'll be evaluating your solution based on how well you solve the problem, readability/maintainability/style of your code, and UI/UX judgement and attention to detail.
